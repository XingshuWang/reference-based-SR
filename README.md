# reference-based-SR

In this project, we intend to conduct an in-depth study in the field of reference-based-SR. Ref SR refers to supplementing the details of the input low resolution (LR) image by introducing rich textures of the high resolution (HR) image. In the initial stage of my research, I intend to study existing papers. My supervisors recommended the following papers to me, and I intend to conduct in-depth analysis and study on them.
